# lab4

for the lab4 questionA,we get the reaction of following answer:
000000000040052d T average(int, float)
00000000004004ed T average(double*, double&)

for the questionB, we get the following result
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

the numbers in the left side are size of char,int,float,double. this information told us
that how many bits each forms= use iu C++ program; and the numbers right side are all the same since it 
just represent how mant bits an adress used.
